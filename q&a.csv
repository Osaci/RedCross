"I would like to donate clothes, cars or other items to charity. Does the American Red Cross accept donated goods?Unfortunately, due to logistical constraints the Red Cross does not accept or solicit individual donations or collections of items. Items such as collected food, used clothing and shoes must be sorted, cleaned, repackaged and transported which impedes the valuable resources of money, time, and personnel.The Red Cross does accept bulk quantities of product and services when these items meet our service delivery needs. These donations typically come from manufacturers, suppliers, and/or distributors that can package the items in bulk, palletize them and transport them directly to Red Cross sites. Financial contributions allow the Red Cross to purchase exactly what is needed for a disaster relief operation. Monetary donations also enable the Red Cross to purchase relief supplies close to the disaster site which avoids delays and transportation costs in getting basic necessities to disaster victims. Because the affected community has generally experienced significant economic loss, purchasing relief supplies in or close to the disaster site also helps to stimulate the weakened local economy.."

"I want to help raise money for a specific family who was affected by disaster. Can I make my gift through the Red Cross?We applaud your desire to help a family at a difficult time, but unfortunately gifts for a specific family or person cannot be made through the Red Cross.

The American Red Cross will not sell, trade, or share personal information about our financial donors with anyone else, nor will we send mailings to our financial donors on behalf of other organizations, unless a donor has given us specific permission to do so."
""
"Why do you require another identification number besides my credit card number?The Card Security Code (CSC) is a 3- or 4-digit number printed on your credit card. It provides added security when you use your card on the Internet or over the phone. The number appears only on the card itself, not on receipts or statements."
""
"Why do you require a minimum donation amount of $10?Credit card thieves regularly use websites like ours to test the validity of stolen card numbers. The cards are commonly tested using small dollar amounts in an effort to avoid detection by both the cardholder and card processor. The Red Cross has established a $10 minimum credit card donation to deter fraudulent use of our website, which helps us protect the cardholder and prevents us from incurring financial penalties by the card issuer."

But the Red Cross does not accept or solicit individual donations or collections of items due to logistical constraints that are often associated with the acceptance of them. Items such as collections of food, used clothing and shoes must be sorted, cleaned, repackaged and transported which impedes the valuable resources of money, time, and personnel.

Getting Assistance

Our focus is to ensure those impacted are provided safe shelter, food, emotional support, health services, and critical relief items. Once emergent needs are met the Red Cross works one-on-one with clients to help them plan their recovery."
""
"What kinds of emergency services are not provided by the Red Cross?Services such as evacuation coordination, search and rescue, advanced medical care, pet sheltering and medical sheltering are best performed by government agencies or organizations that have the resources, trained workers and expertise to carry out those functions.

""
"Will the Red Cross replace groceries or food lost because of a power outage?No. Power outages are often widespread and sometimes affect hundreds of thousands of people.

International Humanitarian Law
""
"What is International Humanitarian Law?Even in times of war, there are restrictions on whom you can fight and how you can fight them. International humanitarian law (IHL) is a set of universal rules which place basic limits on how war is waged. They protect people who are not fighting, like civilians, and people who can no longer fight, like sick and wounded soldiers or those that surrender.On August 12, 1949, the four Geneva Conventions in their current form came into being. Now adopted by the United States and every other nation, they are the cornerstone of international humanitarian law, also known as the law of war or the law of armed conflict."
""
"When does IHL apply?International humanitarian law governs warfare between nations and also applies during non-international armed conflicts, like civil wars. It does not apply to sporadic acts of violence such as riots. The law only applies when a conflict has begun, and then equally to all sides regardless of who started the fighting."
""
"Who does IHL protect?IHL protects people who are not directly participating in hostilities. This includes women, children, refugees, journalists, Red Cross and other humanitarian aid workers, wounded, shipwrecked, or sick members of the armed forces, prisoners of war, medics, and religious personnel."
""
"What are the basic rules of IHL?Some of the specific protections provided under IHL include:Enemies who surrender or unable to fight cannot be killed or wounded.The wounded and sick must be cared for, even if they are from the opposing side.All medical personnel and hospitals must be protected.Prisoners of war and those detained in relation to a conflict must be respected and protected. They also have the right to communicate with their families and to receive food, shelter and medical care.No one can be subjected to torture.Civilians and civilian property cannot be the targets of attacks.Those protected by the law are entitled to fundamental judicial guarantees."
""
"Are humanitarian law and human rights law different?International humanitarian law and human rights laware complentary. Both aim to protect the life, health and dignity of individuals.IHL contains rules that govern the conduct of war and provide protections for the vulnerable, such as civilians and wounded soldiers. These laws only apply in times of war and all parties to a conflict must follow them.Human rights law applies in peacetime but does not contain any restrictions on how wars can be fought. These laws apply during both war and peace. Moreover, unlike IHL, some human rights can be suspended in times of national emergency."
""
"Is it a violation of IHL if civilians are killed during war?A major objective of IHL is to protect civilians. Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, civilians are to be protected from murder and permitted to lead normal lives, if security allows. The principle of distinction strictly prohibits the deliberate targeting of civilians or their property.However, if an attack is on a military target and in line with the military objective, the fact that civilians could also be killed does not necessarily make it unlawful."
""
"How does IHL protect women?While women have the same general legal protections as men, the Geneva Conventions also recognize that women should benefit from additional protections based on gender differences. As a result, rape, enforced prostitution or any form of indecent assault are strictly prohibited. To learn more about women and armed conflict, see the ICRC study""Women Facing War""."
""
"How does IHL protect children?Theprotection of childrenin wartime is another important part of IHL. In addition to general protections for civilians, children must also be protected against any form of abuse if they fall into the hands of the enemy. The Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols of 1977 lay down a series of special protections that recognize the particular vulnerability of children and their needs in armed conflicts.IHL also prohibits children from taking part in hostilities. It requires thatchildren under 15not be recruited into the armed forces, and that ""all feasible measures"" be taken to ensure that they do not take a direct part in the fighting. The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child prohibits the recruitment of children under the age of 18, although children ages 15 to 18 can still join voluntarily."
""
"How is IHL enforced?Unfortunately, international humanitarian law is not always observed. Sometimes,violationsresult from a lack of discipline amongst troops. Other times, one side may believe that humanitarian law does not apply to their own actions because the other side is not following the same rules. Yet, humanitarian law is binding in all situations.All nations are legally obligated to uphold IHL in the midst of war and are required to enact domestic laws to enforce legal sanctions against violators. The Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) is an example of this legislation in the United States.Legal action against alleged perpetrators of violations of IHL can also take place before an international tribunal, as was the case after World War II and follwing the conflicts in Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.The International Criminal Courtcan also exercise jurisdiction over war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in situations where national systems are either unable or unwilling to prosecute alleged perpetrators."
""
"Why is the Red Cross teaching Americans about IHL?As a “federally chartered insturmentality of the United States”, the American Red Cross is charged with carrying out the purposes of the Geneva Conventions. The Red Cross is obligated on behalf of the people and the government of the United States to help Americans know and respect these laws and the humanitarian principles they reflect.In the United States, international humanitarian law education is a responsibility shared by the Department of Defense which focuses on service members, and the American Red Cross which focuses on the general public. At hundreds of Red Cross chapters throughout the country, staff and volunteers help adults and youth understand international humanitarian law and its relevance to daily life."
""
"What is my role?If the rules are going to be obeyed during armed conflict, they must be understood before armed conflict breaks out. With armed conflicts ongoing around the globe and significant American millitary operations overseas, the need for understanding of these rules is as critical as ever.By understanding the difference IHL makes to millions of people around the world and close to home, you can contribute to the reduction of suffering. By sharing this information with others, you can help build greater awareness of IHL and the need for humanity in the midst of war. Exposing Americans to humanitarian issues also inspires students, parents and educators to make positive choices and contributions in their lives, communities and beyond.You can make a difference. Askyour local Red Cross chapterhow you can get involved or email us atIHLaw@redcross.org."
""
"How can I learn more about IHL?The American Red Cross provides opportunities to learn more through its international humanitarian law program that offers an introductory level course that raises awareness about the Geneva Conventions, the basic rules of international humanitarian law, and the role of the Red Cross during armed conflict. Through a hands-on approach utilizing group activities, class discussion and compelling multimedia, this course invites participants to reflect on their images and perceptions of armed conflict and explore the powerful and fundamental concept of human dignity even in the midst of war. The American Red Cross also offers the Exploring Humanitarian Law educational toolkit for students and educators. To find out if a chapter near you is offering the half-day course or other opportunities, pleasecontact your local chapteror email us at atIHLaw@redcross.org."
""
"What is Exploring Humanitarian Law?Youth need to learn about international humanitarian law, as future leaders and policymakers. Learning the rules that govern warfare is essential to understanding the complexities of foreign affairs.The Red Cross Exploring Humanitarian Law (EHL) helps middle and high school teachers introduce global humanitarian principles in their classrooms. It offers a customizable set of resources that help students understand the rules governing war and their impact on human life and dignity. Furthermore, it challenges students to investigate real situations and discuss some of the most important humanitarian questions facing us today.

International Services
""
"How, when and why does the American Red Cross respond to international disasters?As part of the world’s largest humanitarian network, the American Red Cross maintains a corps of trained disaster responders and strategically positions relief supplies worldwide to deliver immediate support. Our help is triggered by a request from the local Red Cross or Red Crescent team in the country affected and can take the form of relief supplies, cash, telecommunications, mapping, disaster management, and other contributions. See more informationhere."
""
"Does the American Red Cross accept donated household items for natural disasters that occur overseas?The Red Cross is also unable to accept collections of items such as clothing, food or cleaning supplies. The cost to sort, package and distribute these types of items is almost always greater than the cost of purchasing the items locally, and it is logistically impossible to distribute the items as the sender intended. In rare cases, the Red Cross can only accept bulk quantities of product and services from manufacturers, suppliers, and/or distributors as in-kind donations. In-kind product must be non-expired, palletized and transported at the donor's expense. Seethis pagefor more information."
""
"How do I volunteer for the American Red Cross overseas?Most Red Cross and Red Crescent societies in other countries have their own employees and volunteers who are trained and prepared to respond to disasters. If support is requested by a sister society, the American Red Cross can tap into our cadre of disaster specialists, who are specially trained to manage and contribute to international emergency response. For more information,click here."
""
"How can the American Red Cross help reach a loved one living overseas during war, conflict or following a natural disaster?The American Red Cross helps to reconnect thousands of refugees, immigrants and other individuals with their families each year by partnering with our sister Red Cross and Red Crescent societies around the world to locate missing loved ones separated by war, conflict or disaster. Visit your local American Red Cross chapter or call our free national helpline at 844-782-9441 for more information about ourinternational family tracing services.If you are concerned about a U.S. citizen living or traveling in another country, call the U.S. Department of State at 1-888-407-4747 for assistance."
""
"How is the American Red Cross connected to other Red Cross and Red Crescent societies around the world?Throughout the world, all Red Cross and Red Crescent activities have one central purpose: to help those who suffer without discrimination. The American Red Cross works closely with our sister societies—who share and promote the same humanitarian values—to improve basic living conditions of those in chronically deprived and marginalized areas of the world. Depending on the needs within their respective countries, the local Red Cross society may provide slightly different services day-to-day, but in a crisis we are able to leverage our unparalleled access, community presence, local knowledge and trust to assist in a coordinated and consistent way."
""
"What is the difference between the red cross, red crescent and red crystal symbols?The emblems are universally recognized symbols of assistance for the victims of war and disaster. The Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols spell out how the red cross, red crescent and red crystal are used to protect people, vehicles and structures during war as well as identify routine humanitarian services within a country. International humanitarian law also specifies the use, size, purpose and placing of the emblems as well as the penalties for misuse. While these emblems are not intended to convey a religious or political affiliation, certain countries opt to use one over the other for cultural appropriateness. The red crystal is an optional emblem, equal in status to the red cross and red crescent, but used only in environments where another emblem could be perceived as not being neutral. In addition, though not included in the Geneva Conventions, the red shield of David identifies the Magen David Adom, the national humanitarian society in Israel."

Ready When the Time Comes
""
What is Ready When the Time Comes (RWTC)?Ready When the Time Comes (RWTC) is a corporate volunteer program that was founded and sponsored by W.W. Grainger Inc. The purpose is to prepare corporate employee volunteer teams who can be quickly deployed for short duration disaster events within the local area.
""
"Why is Ready When the Time Comes (RWTC) needed?Each year, the American Red Cross responds to an average of 70,000 disasters – hurricanes, fires, storms, floods, tornados, explosions, etc. – serving those affected with shelter, mass care and financial assistance. Some of these events may stretch local resources. RWTC provides local Red Cross units with additional resources that can be quickly deployed for a variety of support roles during a disaster. The program also fulfills local corporate partner’s desire to support their local communities with their corporate resources."
""
"Is Ready When the Time Comes (RWTC) available in every Red Cross chapter?Unfortunately, RWTC is not available in every chapter in the U.S. As of 2011, it is available in 52 Red Cross chapters. The program was first developed in 2000 as a partnership between the American Red Cross of Greater Chicago and W.W. Grainger, Inc. With the support of W.W. Grainger, Inc. as the National Founding Sponsor, RWTC rolled out as a national pilot program limited to a number of chapters. The goal of the three-year pilot program was to have 16 chapters working in partnership with 100+ corporate partners with several thousand trained RWTC volunteers in place and to have created a model that can be efficiently replicated nationwide. With the success of the demonstration project the RWTC program has grown and is now available in several American Red Cross chapters across the country. Please check with your local Red Cross for more information on program locations.Please contact Marcela Espinoza, National RWTC Program Manager atmarcela.espinoza@redcross.orgor (917) 416-9004."
""
"How does Ready When the Time Comes (RWTC) work?RWTC is a ""top down"" program, where the management of a company signs on before employees are recruited. The recruitment of volunteers for RWTC is usually conducted by the partner company itself. (Some companies send e-mails or post information about the program on an Intranet site. Others place it in the company newsletter). Companies partner with their local Red Cross chapter, recruiting employees as volunteers who then are trained by the chapter as disaster-response volunteers. Partner companies commit to making these employees available for service at least one day per year. When a local, large-scale disaster occurs, the Red Cross contacts their RWTC company liaisons, who then call their RWTC employee volunteers into action. The chapter then assumes responsibility for their deployment and management."
""
"What are Ready When the Time Comes (RWTC) volunteers trained to do?RWTC volunteers may be trained in such specialty areas of service as:ShelteringMass Care and FeedingDamage AssessmentBulk DistributionCaseworkMedical or Mental Health (licensed professionals only)Community Response CenterIntake and Management of Spontaneous VolunteersMedia and Public RelationsPartner LiaisonOther services, as needed by the local Red Cross Chapter"
""
"How do local Ready When the Time Comes (RWTC) Partner companies benefit?Partner companies benefit in a number of ways, including:Supporting employees in their desire to help, particularly in times of great local need, which in turn raises employee morale, increases loyalty and helps companies retain valuable employees;Visibility – companies are seen to be a supportive community partner, which leads to good public opinion toward the company as being socially responsible;RWTC associates the name of the company and brand with one of the most trusted and charitable organizations in the world, the American Red Cross;RWTC companies are acknowledged in the local chapter's communication materials – including website and newsletters."
""
"What is required of Ready When the Time Comes (RWTC) partners?Generally, partner companies are asked to:Sign a non-binding statement of understanding, the content of which is jointly developed with the chapter, which helps establish the partnership;Identify primary and secondary coordinators for the RWTC Program who can be available 24/7 as contacts for the chapter and, in turn, to activate their volunteer teams;Take the lead in recruiting their employees as volunteers to fill specific needs identified by the chapter;Provide logistical support and space for training of their RWTC volunteers by the Red Cross;Allow their volunteers to respond to a deployment request during normal work hours if required;Allow their volunteers to participate in at least one mock disaster drill each year."
""
"Are partner companies required to make a financial contribution to the Red Cross?There is no requirement to make a financial contribution to be an RWTC partner company. RWTC is first and foremost an opportunity for employee volunteers to support Red Cross disaster response. We hope that as our relationship grows that partner companies will look for additional opportunities to support our work – through involvement by employees in non-disaster volunteer opportunities, financial and in-kind contributions, or participation on our board of directors or committees."
""
"What do Ready When the Time Comes (RWTC) employee volunteers gain?RWTC volunteers gain vital training enabling them to assist in a large-scale disaster. Participating in the RWTC Program increases confidence, as well as involving employees in meaningful and rewarding volunteer work. Volunteers have the opportunity to make a real difference in their community, meet new friends, and learn new skills."
""
"What are the Requirements for volunteers?All RWTC volunteers are required to:Participate in Red Cross provided training in one or more specialty areas of service; may receive additional on-site training to take on additional rolesBe prepared to deploy within 24 hours when requestedParticipate in at least one annual disaster drillAll Red Cross volunteers are required to participate in an online national criminal background check, either when they volunteer or at the time of deployment.They may be asked to:Stand ready for on-site training to take on additional roles;Consider participating in non-disaster volunteer opportunities in the chapter."
""
Who will manage Ready When the Time Comes (RWTC) volunteers when they are deployed?RWTC volunteers will be managed by employees or trained disaster volunteers of the Red Cross.
""
"Who can be an Ready When the Time Comes (RWTC) volunteer?If the partner company agrees, not only active employees but also members of their families and retirees and their family members are welcome to participate in RWTC."
""
"Does the Red Cross provide insurance coverage for Ready When the Time Comes (RWTC) volunteers?Yes. Our commercial general liability insurance covers volunteers for personal liability that they may incur while acting as agents of the Red Cross. A volunteer is considered to be an agent of the Red Cross when he or she is acting under the direct control and supervision of the Red Cross and within the scope of his or her Red Cross duties. We normally do not indemnify another party in these situations. Also, workers’ compensation does not extend to volunteers in most situations. Full details of insurance coverage are available upon request."
""
"Are Ready When the Time Comes (RWTC) volunteers deployed to national disasters outside of the chapter's service area?Although Ready When the Time Comes was originally, and still is, designed to provide chapters with local RWTC corporate employee volunteer teams, some corporations and other Non Government Organization partners have occasionally expressed a positive interest in deploying their employees on large, national disaster operations.RWTC corporate volunteer employee team are encouraged to deploy beyond their unit, but we ask that they give us a work week; that is, travel on a weekend, work for five days and return on a weekend; although we’d welcome a longer commitment.The partner and the deploying team will be fully briefed and understand the potential hardships they may encounter, including berthing in staff shelters, adverse weather and working conditions, physical and medical restrictions, as well as the need for just-in-time training at the operation. We will try to deploy teams closest to the Disaster Relief Operation first and then expand opportunities from there. The decision to deploy RWTC teams beyond the unit is ultimately based on the needs of the relief operation. We want to ensure that our partner teams have the best possible experience; and that their talents and experience are fully utilized on the operation.Possible deployment to any disaster operation is initiated and coordinated through the affiliated chapter.If you have a corporate team that has expressed an interest in sending a RWTC team out to one of our ongoing relief operations, contact Marcela Espinoza atmarcela.espinoza@redcross.orgor by phone at (917) 416-9004 and we will work with you and our DSHR staffing to see if we can make this happen."

Reconnecting Families
""
"What services does the American Red Cross offer to reconnect families?The American Red Cross provides tracing and messaging services. Traces can be initiated in cases where the location of a loved one is unknown. The American Red Cross caseworker will gather the available information and then American Red Cross will work with its international Red Cross and Red Crescent partners to try to locate the sought person. The American Red Cross also provides Red Cross Messaging services. Red Cross messages can be used to facilitate communication internationally in instances where the sought person’s location is known, but regular means of communication are unavailable."
""
"Who does the Red Cross count as family?Family is defined broadly by the American Red Cross to account for cultural and personal differences in the way family is defined. Generally, the Red Cross will search for any loved one as long as communication had been established at one point and was then severed by a humanitarian emergency."
""
What will you do with my personal details?The personal information that we collect from you is completely confidential and is used only to help find your missing relative. We will only disclose the information you provided to us with your consent.
""
Can the Red Cross help bring someone into the United States?The American Red Cross has no role in bringing persons from other countries to the United States or securing or verifying visas. The United States government processes all requests for travel to the United States. The process usually begins at the overseas United States Embassy in the country where the person wishing to travel to the United States lives.
""
"In what situations does the American Red Cross help to reconnect families?The American Red Cross helps to reconnect families separated internationally by war, disaster, migration and other humanitarian emergencies. Requests can be accepted from family members who were in contact before the emergency situation separated them. A sufficient amount of information on the missing family member is needed to initiate a search. Service may not be available in all countries or all areas of specific countries due to security restrictions or accessibility barriers. If you would like to initiate an international search for a family member, please contactyour local American Red Crossoffice."
""
"Why is the Red Cross involved in tracing?When countries become signatories to the Geneva Conventions, their governments agree to apply certain protections to non-combatants (POWs, civilians, etc.) during armed conflict. They also agree to help people locate family members separated by armed conflict. Each country is required to establish a single Red Cross or Red Crescent that works with other members in this global network to trace missing relatives, among other responsibilities. Clara Barton, founder of the American Red Cross, started tracing during the American Civil War when she carried messages between wounded soldiers and their families. More than a century later, the American Red Cross continues to provide information, comfort and relief to families separated by wars, disasters and other humanitarian emergencies."
""
Does the American Red Cross charge for tracing services?No. American Red Cross tracing services are free.
""
"If I live outside the United States, where can I go for tracing services?If you live outside the United States, you should contact the Red Cross or Red Crescent in your own country. You can view a list of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies on the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies website atwww.ifrc.org.Criteria for accepting cases varies from country to country, andyour local Red Crossor Red Crescent will be able to direct you to appropriate resources within your country."

""
"Do other organizations provide Holocaust tracing services?Yes. However, while there are other organizations devoted to Holocaust research, documentation, and remembrance, the Red Cross is unique in its mission to use archives located throughout the world to trace missing loved ones. In fact, many well-known organizations such as the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum refer people to the Red Cross regularly."
""
"Are Holocaust and World War II Victims tracing services available only to Jews?No. The Red Cross serves anyone who wishes to obtain documentation or learn the fates of family members they were separated from during the Holocaust or World War II. The criteria for accepting a case is that the separation occurred in Europe between 1933 and 1957 as a result of Nazi actions.It is well known that the Nazis and their collaborators imprisoned or killed more than 11 million people including 6 million Jews who were especially targeted for extermination. Polish Catholics, clergy, gypsies, Jehovah's Witnesses, Ukrainians, Russian soldiers, homosexuals, and the disabled were also targets for forced labor, medical experiments, and murder."
""
"Can the Red Cross help me to send medicine, money or other articles to family members overseas?The American Red Cross cannot transmit medications, money, or other articles to individuals in other countries. Businesses such as money transfer companies, shipping companies, or pharmaceutical companies regularly provide these services."
""
"Can the Red Cross help Holocaust survivors obtain restitution?The American Red Cross Restoring Family Links program can help to search for the documentation required by many of the restitution funds, including documentation of forced labor or internment in a concentration camp. There are numerous restitution funds available from many different sources.

The Red Cross also supports service members and their families at Veterans Affairs (VA) and military hospitals, in communities throughout the U.S., and on military installations around the world. The organization continues to enhance existing programs and establish new services to meet the needs of today’s service members, veterans and their families."
""
"Why doesn't the American Red Cross provide the same services for the public as it does to members of the armed forces?Military service is unique, frequently separating families for extended periods of time and often placing loved ones in harm’s way. Red Cross emergency communication services keep families in this unique situation connected when an emergency occurs back home. Our 24/7 communications system enables military families to apply to military aid societies for emergency financial assistance.With the exception of these two unique services, the Red Cross provides similar services to both military and civilian populations, including disaster assistance and access to preparedness training and education."
""
"Why can't the military provide for communication between members of the armed forces and their families, instead of the Red Cross?Even at a time when families can stay connected through e-mail and cell phones, the Red Cross communications service is critical during times of emergency. Red Cross workers are able to quickly verify the circumstances of a family emergency and provide a verified and confidential report to a service member’s commanding officer. This helps military authorities make timely, informed decisions on when, and whether, to send someone home armed with the best information available. When days, hours and minutes matter, the Red Cross is able to help make a trusted connection."

However, for skill practice, an accommodation may be made to have the manikin on an elevated surface that is firm, flat and stable."
